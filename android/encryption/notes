Obtaining a raw copy of a disk partition is usually not possible on most commercial devices, but can be achieved by booting a specialized data acquisition boot image signed by the device manufacturer,  exploiting a flaw in the bootloader that allows unsigned images to be booted (such as this one), or simply by booting a custom recovery image on devices with an unlocked bootloader (a typical first step to 'rooting').
