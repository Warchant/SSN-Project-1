\section{Dealing with disk encryption}
In this section we are going to explain what attacker can do if disk encryption is enabled. We assume, that attacker has linux shell enabled, which he could get using attacks from the section \ref{a}.

\subsection{Partial disk encryption (user's home folder)}



\subsection{Full disk encryption}\label{fde}
In this subsection we consider a computer with installed Linux Mint, which offers to use encrypted LVM2 by default to encrypt the whole disk.
