There are numerous ways to protect a device, but in this paper we can see that even full-disk encryption does not necessarily protects from all kinds of threats. Achieving security is a complex task which cannot be accomplished with technical measures alone, we always have to consider some sort of organizational measures apart from that.

In this paper we demonstrated different attacks using latest known vulnerabilities on unattended devices and presented mitigation techniques to prevent such attacks in the future.
